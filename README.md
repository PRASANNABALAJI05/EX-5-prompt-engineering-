# EXP 5: Comparative Analysis of Naïve Prompting versus Basic Prompting Using ChatGPT Across Various Test Scenarios
# Aim: To test how ChatGPT responds to naïve prompts (broad or unstructured) versus basic prompts (clearer and more refined) across multiple scenarios, analyzing the quality, accuracy, and depth of the generated responses.
# Algorithm: 

### 1. Define the Two Prompt Types

- **Naïve Prompts**: Broad, vague, or open-ended prompts with little specificity.
- **Basic Prompts**: Clear, detailed, and structured prompts that give specific instructions or context to guide the model.

---

### 2. Prepare Multiple Test Scenarios

Select a diverse range of scenarios:
- Generating a creative story
- Answering a factual question
- Summarizing an article or concept
- Providing advice or recommendations
- [Optional: Add any custom scenario relevant to your needs]

For each scenario, design both:
- A **naïve prompt**
- A **basic prompt** (targeting the same task with clearer structure)

---

### 3. Run Experiments with ChatGPT

- Input the naïve prompt and record the response.
- Input the basic prompt for the same scenario and record that response.
- Repeat for each scenario to gather complete data.

---

### 4. Evaluate Responses

Compare responses on the following criteria:
- **Quality** (coherence, fluency, tone)
- **Accuracy** (correctness, factual integrity)
- **Depth** (detail, completeness of answer)

Also answer:
- Does ChatGPT consistently give better results with basic prompts?
- Are there scenarios where naïve prompts perform equally well?

### ✅ Prompt Comparison Table

| Scenario | Naïve Prompt | Naïve Response Summary | Basic Prompt | Basic Response Summary | Observations |
|----------|--------------|------------------------|--------------|------------------------|--------------|
| Story Generation | "Tell a story." | Generic plot, lacks structure | "Write a short story about a lonely robot who finds a friend in a deserted city." | Rich narrative, emotional arc | Basic prompt yielded deeper engagement |
| Factual Q&A | "What is AI?" | Very general overview | "Explain what Artificial Intelligence is in two sentences suitable for a high school student." | Concise, accurate, age-appropriate | Basic prompt provided clearer output |
| Advice | "Give me advice." | Ambiguous, unclear focus | "Give me 3 tips for staying focused while studying." | Specific, actionable tips | Basic prompt much more useful |
| Summarization | "Summarize this." | Vague summary, lacks context | "Summarize the key points of the article about climate change in under 100 words." | Clear, accurate summary | Basic prompt provided better structure |

## Summary of Findings

- **Prompt Clarity Matters**: Basic prompts consistently resulted in more relevant, accurate, and in-depth responses.
- **Naïve Prompts Work Sometimes**: In open-ended creative tasks, naïve prompts produced usable results but still lacked structure.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Always add context and intent.
  - Be specific with format and length if needed.
  - Avoid vague commands like "Explain" or "Tell me something."

# OUTPUT
### Scenario 1: Creative Story Generation

- **Naïve Prompt**:  
  `"Tell a story."`

- **Naïve Response**:  
  > Once upon a time, there was a cat who lived in a forest. It liked to chase birds and climb trees. One day it got lost and found a new home.

- **Basic Prompt**:  
  `"Write a short story about a lonely robot who finds a friend in a deserted city."`

- **Basic Response**:  
  > In a quiet, forgotten city, a lonely robot named R1 wandered the streets, echoing memories of humanity. One day, it discovered a small drone trapped under debris. R1 rescued it, and together they formed a bond, bringing life back to the abandoned city.

---

### Scenario 2: Factual Question Answering

- **Naïve Prompt**:  
  `"What is AI?"`

- **Naïve Response**:  
  > AI stands for artificial intelligence. It is used in many areas and helps machines think like humans.

- **Basic Prompt**:  
  `"Explain what Artificial Intelligence is in two sentences suitable for a high school student."`

- **Basic Response**:  
  > Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that allows machines to mimic human thinking and problem-solving. It's used in technologies like voice assistants, self-driving cars, and recommendation systems.

---

### Scenario 3: Advice or Recommendations

- **Naïve Prompt**:  
  `"Give me advice."`

- **Naïve Response**:  
  > You should try your best and not give up.

- **Basic Prompt**:  
  `"Give me three effective tips for staying focused while studying at home."`

- **Basic Response**:  
  > 1. Create a dedicated, clutter-free study space.  
  > 2. Use the Pomodoro technique—study for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break.  
  > 3. Turn off notifications on your devices to reduce distractions.

---

### Scenario 4: Summarization

- **Naïve Prompt**:  
  `"Summarize this."`

- **Naïve Response**:  
  > The article talks about climate change and its effects on the planet.

- **Basic Prompt**:  
  `"Summarize the key points of the article on climate change in under 100 words, highlighting causes and impacts."`

- **Basic Response**:  
  > The article outlines how greenhouse gas emissions from human activities, like burning fossil fuels, are the main cause of climate change. It explains the consequences, such as rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and biodiversity loss, urging urgent action to reduce emissions and adopt sustainable practices.
